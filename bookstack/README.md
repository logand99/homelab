# BookStack Docker Configuration

This folder contains my Docker Compose setup for hosting BookStack ‚Äî a self-hosted documentation platform used to organize and store technical notes, guides, and homelab documentation.

BookStack acts as my internal wiki for both professional knowledge and homelab infrastructure reference.

## üìò Use Case: Personal Documentation Archive

BookStack is where I document:

- Complex or rarely-used system configurations (e.g., firewall rules, Linux tuning)
- Homelab service deployment notes
- Networking concepts and design patterns I've encountered professionally
- Quick CLI reference guides and troubleshooting procedures
