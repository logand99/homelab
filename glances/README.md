# Glances Docker Configuration

This folder contains the Docker Compose configuration I use to deploy [Glances](https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/) ‚Äî a lightweight, web-based system monitoring tool. I run Glances on several key devices in my homelab to monitor system health, resource usage, and uptime in real time.

---

## üìà Use Case: Homelab Health Monitoring

Glances provides:
- Real-time CPU, memory, disk, and network stats
- Web-based access to system metrics
- Cross-platform compatibility (ARM & x86)
- A single dashboard per device for at-a-glance diagnostics

| Host            | Platform       | Notes                                   |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 5   | Docker on ARM  | Main Docker host (Portainer, Gluetun)  |
| Raspberry Pi 4   | Docker on ARM  | Primary Pi-hole server                  |
| Hetzner VM       | Docker on ARM  | Main cloud services node                |

Each host runs its own Glances container using the same Compose file, with minor local adjustments.
