# Heimdall Docker Configuration

This folder contains Docker Compose files for two instances of Heimdall ‚Äî a simple, self-hosted dashboard used to navigate and access services in my homelab and cloud environments.

Heimdall acts as the central launch point for my day-to-day system use.

---

## üß© Use Case: Dashboard for Homelab Services

Heimdall is used to:

- Organize links to internal and cloud-hosted services
- Provide a visual homepage for frequently accessed tools
- Separate **on-prem** and **cloud-based** resources for clarity
- Launch browser-based tools and dashboards quickly
