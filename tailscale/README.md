# Tailscale Docker Configurations

This folder contains Docker Compose files for two Tailscale containers I use across my homelab infrastructure. Tailscale provides secure, encrypted connectivity between my home network, cloud-hosted services, and remote devices ‚Äî without the need to expose any ports.

---

## üîß Overview

Tailscale is deployed in two key locations:

### üè† 1. Home Network Instance
- **Compose File:** `docker-compose.home.yml`
- **Platform:** Raspberry Pi (Docker, Portainer)
- **Purpose:**
  - Advertises local home LAN subnets (e.g., `192.168.0.0/24`) to the Tailnet
  - Allows remote access to internal services like Pi-hole, Portainer, TrueNAS, and more
  - Enables SSH and browser access to internal IPs from anywhere without port forwarding

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è 2. Hetzner Cloud Instance
- **Compose File:** `docker-compose.hetzner.yml`
- **Platform:** Hetzner ARM VM (Docker, Portainer)
- **Purpose:**
  - Advertises the internal Docker network (`192.168.19.0/24`) to the Tailnet
  - Acts as a **fallback access method** for cloud services if public routes (e.g., via Nginx Proxy Manager) are unavailable
  - Securely connects cloud-hosted services to my private network without exposing ports

---

## üåê Features

- Encrypted peer-to-peer connectivity over WireGuard
- Subnet routing for seamless hybrid access
- No port forwarding required
- Integrated ACL and device authorization via the Tailscale admin dashboard
