# Draw.io (diagrams.net) Docker Configuration

This folder contains the Docker Compose configuration for my self-hosted instance of [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) (also known as diagrams.net).

I use Draw.io as my primary tool for creating network diagrams, architecture charts, and service maps to document my homelab and internal infrastructure visually.
