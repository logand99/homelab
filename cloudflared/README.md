# Cloudflared Docker Configuration

This folder contains Docker Compose configurations for my self-hosted [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/). These tunnels allow me to securely expose select homelab services to the internet **without opening any inbound ports** on my firewall or router.

All traffic is encrypted and proxied through Cloudflare‚Äôs global network, and identity-based access control is handled using **Cloudflare Access policies**.

## üîß Deployment Overview

| Instance Location | Purpose                          | Managed With |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| Raspberry Pi      | Tunnel to home network services  | Portainer    |
| Hetzner Cloud VM  | Tunnel to cloud services         | Portainer    |

Each tunnel runs as a Docker container using the `cloudflared` image.

## üîê Security Model

All exposed services are protected with **Cloudflare Access** policies:

- Users must enter a **pre-approved email address**
- Cloudflare sends a **one-time access code** to verified users
- Requests from unapproved emails are denied (no code sent)
- Once authenticated, access is passed to the internal service (which may have its own login)

## üåê Exposed Services

| Service      | Location       | Tunnel Target | Notes                                |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Guacamole    | Raspberry Pi   | HTTPS (internal) | Used for browser-based RDP access    |
| NTFY         | Raspberry Pi   | HTTPS (internal) | Homelab notifications over tunnel    |

> Note: Nginx Proxy Manager handles local routing, TLS is managed by Cloudflare at the edge.
