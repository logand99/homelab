# Plex Media Server Docker Configuration

This folder contains Docker Compose files for two instances of Plex that I self-host as part of my homelab and cloud infrastructure. Plex is used to organize and stream my personal collection of movies, TV shows, music, and ebooks ‚Äî with a focus on reliability, secure access, and storage efficiency.

## üé¨ Use Case: Personal Media Streaming

I use Plex to:
- Stream my personal media collection to devices on my network and remotely
- Maintain metadata, watch history, and multiple user profiles
- Enable mobile access through the official Plex apps
- Keep media redundant with a backup server on-prem

| `backup`       | Raspberry Pi 5   | Local fallback    | Used when remote server is offline     |

- Both instances mount the same media directory via **SMB** from a Hetzner Storage Box
