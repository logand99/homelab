# Pi-hole Docker Configurations

This folder contains Docker Compose files for two of my four Pi-hole instances, as well as the configuration for syncing all of them using [`nebula-sync`](https://github.com/lovelaze/nebula-sync).

These setups are part of a distributed DNS system I use across my homelab and cloud infrastructure.
