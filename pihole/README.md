# Pi-hole Docker Configurations

This folder contains Docker Compose files for two of my four Pi-hole instances. These are containerized and managed through Portainer.

I use these instances for:

- DNS filtering and ad-blocking
- Local DNS record management
- Split-DNS architecture between cloud and home networks

All instances are synced using [nebula-sync]([https://github.com/paperbenni/nebula-sync](https://github.com/lovelaze/nebula-sync)).
