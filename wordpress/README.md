# WordPress Docker Configurations

This folder contains Docker Compose files for two public WordPress sites that I self-host using Docker on a Hetzner cloud VM. Each site runs in its own container with isolated volumes and databases, and is routed via Nginx Proxy Manager with HTTPS provided by Let‚Äôs Encrypt.

These WordPress sites are production-ready and backed up automatically as part of my broader 3-2-1 backup strategy.
